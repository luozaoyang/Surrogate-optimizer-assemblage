# Surrogate-optimizer-assemblage
## An assemblage of several prevailing surrogated model-based optimizer for objective optimization
This code targets for non-gradient based optimization. It encompasses several efficeint libraries to minimize extremely expensive black-box functions. All libraries implement  bayesian-based methods.  It includes skopt, Hyperopt, and rbfopt.
